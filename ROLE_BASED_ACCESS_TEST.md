# Role-Based Access Control Testing Report

**Date**: 2025-10-20
**Test Type**: Automated (Playwright) + Manual Testing Required
**Status**: ⏸️ PARTIAL - Code Review Complete, Manual Testing Needed

---

## Executive Summary

Reviewed the role-based access control (RBAC) implementation in the Procurement System. The middleware correctly implements access restrictions for admin routes. However, full end-to-end testing with different user roles requires manual testing due to Playwright session persistence limitations.

---

## Code Review Findings

### ✅ Middleware Protection (src/middleware.ts:1)

**Implementation Analysis**:
```typescript
// Admin-only routes protection
if (pathname.startsWith('/admin')) {
  const userRole = req.auth?.user?.role;
  if (userRole !== 'ADMIN' && userRole !== 'SUPER_ADMIN') {
    return NextResponse.redirect(new URL('/dashboard', req.url));
  }
}
```

**What This Does**:
- Protects all `/admin/*` routes
- Only allows ADMIN and SUPER_ADMIN roles
- Redirects unauthorized users to dashboard
- Runs on every request (server-side protection)

**Security Level**: ✅ **STRONG** - Server-side enforcement prevents unauthorized access

---

## Role Hierarchy

Based on schema and code review:

| Role | Level | Access |
|------|-------|--------|
| SUPER_ADMIN | 4 | Unlimited access to all features |
| ADMIN | 3 | Full access including admin panel |
| MANAGER | 2 | Approval capabilities, no admin panel |
| USER | 1 | Create POs, view own data |

---

## Protected Routes Analysis

### Admin Routes (Requires ADMIN or SUPER_ADMIN)
✅ Protected by middleware:
- `/admin/users` - User management
- `/admin/items` - Catalogue management
- `/admin/suppliers` - Supplier management
- `/admin/companies` - Company management
- `/admin/characters` - Hierarchy management
- `/admin/settings` - System settings

### Public/Authenticated Routes
Available to all logged-in users:
- `/dashboard` - Dashboard
- `/purchase-orders` - PO list
- `/purchase-orders/new` - Create PO
- `/purchase-orders/[id]` - View/Edit PO
- `/approvals` - Approvals workflow
- `/reports` - Reports

**Note**: These routes may have additional role-based UI elements or data filtering not visible in middleware.

---

## Navigation Menu Analysis

### Current SUPER_ADMIN View
From Playwright snapshot, SUPER_ADMIN sees all 10 navigation items:
1. ✅ לוח בקרה (Dashboard)
2. ✅ הזמנות רכש (Purchase Orders)
3. ✅ אישורים (Approvals)
4. ✅ קטלוג פריטים (Items - Admin)
5. ✅ ספקים (Suppliers - Admin)
6. ✅ חברות (Companies - Admin)
7. ✅ מאפיינים (Characters - Admin)
8. ✅ דוחות (Reports)
9. ✅ ניהול משתמשים (Users - Admin)
10. ✅ הגדרות (Settings - Admin)

### Expected Navigation by Role

**USER (Regular Employee)**:
- Dashboard ✓
- Purchase Orders ✓
- Reports ✓
- NO admin sections

**MANAGER (Department Manager/CFO)**:
- Dashboard ✓
- Purchase Orders ✓
- Approvals ✓
- Reports ✓
- NO admin sections

**ADMIN**:
- Dashboard ✓
- Purchase Orders ✓
- Approvals ✓
- Reports ✓
- All Admin sections ✓

**SUPER_ADMIN**:
- Everything ✓

**⚠️ Issue**: No client-side code found that conditionally renders navigation based on role. This means:
1. Either the navigation is not yet implemented with role-based filtering
2. OR all users see all links, but middleware blocks access

**Recommendation**: Add client-side role checks to hide inaccessible menu items.

## Playwright Testing Limitations

### Issue Encountered
- Playwright browser context persists session cookies
- Cannot easily clear NextAuth HTTP-only cookies
- Closing and reopening browser doesn't create fresh session
- Attempted workarounds (localStorage.clear(), cookie manipulation) ineffective

### What Was Tested
✅ Verified middleware code exists and is correctly implemented
✅ Confirmed SUPER_ADMIN can access all routes
✅ Documented expected behavior for each role

### What Requires Manual Testing
⏸️ Login as USER role and verify admin routes redirect
⏸️ Login as MANAGER and verify approval access
⏸️ Verify navigation menu shows/hides based on role
⏸️ Test data-level restrictions (can user edit others' POs?)
⏸️ Test approval limits by role

## Manual Testing Procedure

### Test Case 1: USER Role Restrictions
**Login**: user1@test.com / password123
**Expected Behavior**:
1. Can access dashboard
2. Can view own purchase orders
3. Can create new purchase orders
4. **CANNOT** access `/admin/users` (should redirect to dashboard)
5. **CANNOT** access `/admin/items` (should redirect to dashboard)
6. **CANNOT** see admin menu items in navigation

**Steps**:
1. Open browser in incognito/private mode
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/login
3. Login with user1@test.com / password123
4. Check navigation menu - should NOT see admin items
5. Manually navigate to http://localhost:3001/admin/users
6. Verify redirect to dashboard occurs

---

### Test Case 2: MANAGER Role Restrictions
**Login**: manager@test.com / password123
**Expected Behavior**:
1. Can access dashboard, POs, approvals, reports
2. Can approve POs up to their limit (100,000 ₪)
3. **CANNOT** access any `/admin/*` routes
4. **CANNOT** see admin menu items

**Steps**:
1. Open browser in incognito/private mode
2. Navigate to http://localhost:3001/login
3. Login with manager@test.com / password123
4. Check navigation menu
5. Test approval workflow
6. Attempt to access http://localhost:3001/admin/suppliers
7. Verify redirect

---

### Test Case 3: CFO (MANAGER) Role - High Limit

**Expected Behavior**:
1. Same access as regular MANAGER
2. Can approve POs up to 1,000,000 ₪
3. **CANNOT** access admin panel

---

### Test Case 4: ADMIN Role
**Login**: admin@test.com / password123
**Expected Behavior**:
1. Full access to all routes including `/admin/*`
2. Can manage users, items, suppliers, companies
3. Should see all navigation items

---

### Test Case 5: SUPER_ADMIN Role
**Login**: superadmin@test.com / password123
**Expected Behavior**:
1. Unlimited access
2. No approval limits
3. Can perform any action
4. ✅ Already verified via Playwright

---

## Security Recommendations

### ✅ What's Good
1. Server-side middleware protection prevents unauthorized route access
2. Role hierarchy clearly defined in schema
3. Redirects unauthorized users rather than showing errors

### ⚠️ Improvements Needed

1. **Client-Side Navigation Filtering**
   - Hide admin menu items from non-admin users
   - Improves UX by not showing inaccessible links
   - Prevents confusion

2. **Data-Level Access Control**
   - Verify users can only edit their own POs
   - Managers can only approve within their limits
   - Add tests for these scenarios

3. **API Route Protection**
   - Ensure all API routes check user role
   - Verify CRUD operations respect permissions
   - Example: `/api/users` should require ADMIN role

4. **Approval Workflow Limits**
   - Test that managers cannot approve beyond their monetary limit
   - Verify multi-level approval cascade works

## Test Account Summary

| Email | Password | Role | Approval Limit | Notes |
|-------|----------|------|----------------|-------|
| superadmin@test.com | password123 | SUPER_ADMIN | Unlimited | Full access |
| admin@test.com | password123 | ADMIN | N/A | Admin panel access |
| cfo@test.com | password123 | MANAGER | 1,000,000 ₪ | CFO level |
| manager@test.com | password123 | MANAGER | 100,000 ₪ | Team level |

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Manual Testing)
1. Test all 5 user roles with manual browser testing
2. Verify middleware redirects work correctly
3. Document any issues found

### Short-Term (Code Improvements)
1. Add client-side role checks to navigation menu
2. Implement data-level access controls
3. Add API route protection
4. Create automated E2E tests once session management resolved

### Long-Term (Security Audit)
1. Comprehensive security review
2. Penetration testing
3. Role permission matrix documentation
4. Automated regression tests

## Conclusion

**RBAC Implementation Status**: ✅ **FOUNDATIONAL SECURITY IN PLACE**

The middleware correctly implements server-side route protection for admin sections. However, the implementation appears incomplete:

**What Works**:
- ✅ Server-side route protection
- ✅ Role-based redirects
- ✅ Clean role hierarchy

**What Needs Work**:
- ⚠️ Client-side UI adaptation to user role
- ⚠️ Data-level access controls
- ⚠️ API endpoint protection verification
- ⚠️ Comprehensive testing with all user types

**Security Verdict**: System is protected at the middleware level, but manual testing is required to verify complete RBAC implementation across all features.
