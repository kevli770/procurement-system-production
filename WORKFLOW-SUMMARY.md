# Deployment Workflow - Quick Summary

## üéØ The Complete Process

### üë®‚Äçüíª **Developer (You)**

#### When you're ready to deploy:

**Just tell me:**
> "Ready for production"

**Or:**
> "Create a new release"

**Or:**
> "Deploy version X.X.X"

#### I will automatically:

```bash
npm run release:minor
```

This will:
- ‚úÖ Update package.json (0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.2.0)
- ‚úÖ Create git tag (v0.2.0)
- ‚úÖ Commit changes
- ‚úÖ Push to GitHub (including tags)

**Done! ‚òï Wait 5 minutes.**

---

### ü§ñ **GitHub Actions (Automatic - 5 minutes)**

When GitHub sees the new tag, it automatically:

```
‚úì npm install
‚úì npm run build
‚úì Create optimized ZIP package
‚úì Create GitHub Release
‚úì Attach ZIP to release
‚úì Generate release notes
```

**You can monitor progress:**
```bash
gh run list --limit 1
```

### üìß **You Notify System Administrator**

Send this message:

```
Subject: New Version Ready - v0.2.0

Hi,

Version v0.2.0 is ready for production deployment!

Changes:
- Added phone field to suppliers
- Fixed validation bug

Release: https://github.com/umitgh/procurement-system/releases/tag/v0.2.0

To deploy, run:
.\update-production.ps1 -Version "0.2.0"

Database changes:
‚úì Safe schema updates only
‚úì All existing data will be preserved

Estimated downtime: 2 minutes

```

### üë®‚Äçüíº **System Administrator (On Production Server)**

#### Step 1: Review Release
- Go to: https://github.com/umitgh/procurement-system/releases
- Read what changed
- Check database migration notes

#### Step 2: Connect to Server
```
RDP ‚Üí Windows Server
```

#### Step 3: Run Deployment
```powershell
cd C:\inetpub\procurement\deployment
.\update-production.ps1 -Version "0.2.0"
```

Type: `yes` when prompted

#### Step 4: Wait (~2 minutes)
The script automatically:
- ‚úÖ Creates backup
- ‚úÖ Downloads new version
- ‚úÖ Updates files (preserves .env and database!)
- ‚úÖ Runs database migrations
- ‚úÖ Restarts application
- ‚úÖ Performs health check
- ‚úÖ Auto-rollback if anything fails

#### Step 5: Verify
```powershell
pm2 status
# Should show: online

pm2 logs procurement
# Check for errors

# Open browser: http://localhost:3000
# Test the application
```

#### Step 6: Confirm
Reply to your email:
```
‚úÖ Deployment successful!
Version v0.2.0 is now running.
Status: online
Issues: None
```

## üìä Timeline

| Step | Who | Time |
|------|-----|------|
| 1. Code ready | You | - |
| 2. Create release | You (tell Claude) | 10 seconds |
| 3. GitHub Actions | Automatic | 5 minutes |
| 4. Deploy to server | Sysadmin | 2 minutes |
| **Total** | | **~7 minutes** |
| **Downtime** | | **~2 minutes** |

---

## üîÑ If Something Goes Wrong

### Automatic Rollback
If the health check fails, the script automatically restores the previous version.

**No action needed!**

### Manual Rollback
If you discover issues later:

```powershell
.\rollback-production.ps1 -ToVersion "0.1.0"
```

**Time: 1 minute**

---

## üìù Version Numbering

When you say "ready for production", I'll choose:

- **patch** (0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.1.**1**) - Small bug fix
- **minor** (0.1.0 ‚Üí 0.**2**.0) - New feature (most common)
- **major** (0.1.0 ‚Üí **1**.0.0) - Breaking change / major update

You can also specify:
> "Create a major release" ‚Üí I'll run `npm run release:major`

---

## ‚úÖ Checklist

### Before Release:
- [ ] All features tested locally
- [ ] Build succeeds (`npm run build`)
- [ ] Database migrations created (if needed)
- [ ] Ready to deploy

### After Release:
- [ ] GitHub Actions completed successfully
- [ ] ZIP file available in Releases
- [ ] System administrator notified

## üí° Pro Tips

### For Faster Deployments:
1. Keep the sysadmin informed about upcoming releases
2. Schedule deployments during low-usage hours
3. Test thoroughly before creating a release
4. Always read the release notes before deploying

### For Safety:
1. Never skip backups (script does this automatically)
2. Always verify after deployment
3. Keep recent backups for at least 30 days
4. Test rollback procedure periodically

## ‚ùì FAQs

**Q: Can I deploy directly without telling you?**

A: Yes! Just run `npm run release:minor` yourself. But it's easier to tell me so I can handle everything.

---

**Q: What if I want to test the release before production?**

A: You can download the ZIP from GitHub Releases and test it on a staging server first.

---

**Q: Can I skip versions?**

A: Yes, but not recommended. Sequential versions make tracking easier.

---

**Q: What happens to the old repository (procurement-system)?**

A: It remains unchanged. You can:
- Keep it as an archive
- Delete it (after verifying the new one works)
- Continue using both

---

**Q: Can I undo a release?**

A: The tag and release will stay on GitHub (for history), but you can rollback the production deployment anytime.

---

## üéâ That's It!

**Simple workflow:**
1. You develop
2. You say "ready"
3. I create release
4. GitHub builds it
5. Sysadmin deploys
6. Done!

**Questions?** Just ask! üòä
